Snowplow Micro is a lightweight version of the Snowplow pipeline. It’s great for:
* Getting familiar with Snowplow
* Debugging and testing, including automated testing

Just like a real Snowplow pipeline, Micro receives, validates and enriches events sent by your tracking code.

## Maintainer quick start

First, install [Git][git], [sbt][sbt] and [npm][npm].

Then clone the repository and publish the Collector dependency locally:

```text
git clone git@github.com:snowplow-incubator/snowplow-micro.git
cd snowplow-micro

git clone --branch 3.4.0 --depth 1 git@github.com:snowplow/stream-collector.git
cd stream-collector
sbt +publishLocal && cd ..
```

To run the tests:

```
sbt test
```

To build a Docker image for local testing:
```
cd ui
npm build && cd ..
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

Note the Docker image name in the output.
