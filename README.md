Snowplow Micro is built to enable companies running [Snowplow][snowplow] to build automated CI/CD workflows ensuring upstream data quality.

It is a very small version of a full Snowplow data collection pipeline: small enough that it can be launched by an automated test suite. Snowplow Micro then exposes an API, that can be queried in order to validate your data collection setup as your digital products evolve.

## Quick start

### Using Docker

Snowplow Micro is hosted on Docker Hub ([snowplow/snowplow-micro][docker-micro]) with images available for both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.

The following command can be used to run Micro with the default configuration:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 snowplow/snowplow-micro:1.3.3
```

A [distroless][distroless-repo] image is also provided, which benefits from being smaller and more secure, with the downside of basic utilities (such as a shell) not being present in the image.

The distroless image is tagged as `snowplow/snowplow-micro:1.3.3-distroless` on Docker Hub.

#### Configuring Micro

##### Stream Collector config

[Stream Collector][stream-collector] collects the events sent by Snowplow trackers. The options for configuring the collector are [available here][stream-collector-config]. A minimal example of this file exists at [`example/micro.conf`](./example/micro.conf)

##### Iglu resolver config

The [Iglu][iglu] resolver is used to define where schemas are fetched from. The instructions for configuration are [available here][iglu-resolver-config]. An example of this file exists at [`example/iglu.json`](./example/iglu.json)

##### Running Micro with configuration files

The configuration files must be placed in a folder that is mounted in the Docker container, and the port configured for Micro needs to be exposed. The following examples assume that the configuration files are in the directory `./example/` and that port `9090` is the one to bind on your host machine:

```bash
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/example,destination=/config \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  snowplow/snowplow-micro:1.3.3 \
  --collector-config /config/micro.conf \
  --iglu /config/iglu.json
```

In order to use the embedded Iglu capabilities, the command is the same as above. You only need to add your local Iglu repository in the configurations directory named as `iglu-client-embedded`, as also shown in the [example][example-dir]:

```text
example
├── iglu-client-embedded
│   └── schemas
│       └── com.myvendor
│           └── myschema
│               └── jsonschema
│                   └── 1-0-0
├── iglu.json
└── micro.conf
```

### Using Java

If you cannot use Docker, a Snowplow Micro jar file is hosted on the [Github releases][gh-releases]. As an example, run Micro as:

```bash
java -jar snowplow-micro-1.3.3.jar --collector-config example/micro.conf --iglu example/iglu.json
```

In case you also want an embedded Iglu, apply the same directory structure as shown above and run for example:

```bash
# Unix
java -cp snowplow-micro-1.3.3.jar:example com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.micro.Main --collector-config example/micro.conf --iglu example/iglu.json
# Windows
java -cp snowplow-micro-1.3.3.jar;example com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow.micro.Main --collector-config example/micro.conf --iglu example/iglu.json
```

### Send events and start testing

Once you have successfully started Snowplow Micro, its collector endpoint will be `http://localhost:{PORT}`, e.g. `http://localhost:9090`, to which you can point any of the [Snowplow Trackers][snowplow-trackers] and start sending events.

Then, in your testing workflows, you can use Micro's [REST API][micro-rest-api] endpoints to assert on the collected events:

- `/micro/all`: summary
- `/micro/good`: good events
- `/micro/bad`: bad events
- `/micro/reset`: clears cache

Additionally, if you are using the embedded Iglu capabilities, you can also use the `/micro/iglu` endpoint to check whether your custom schemas can be resolved as:

- `/micro/iglu/{vendorName}/{schemaName}/jsonschema/{schemaVersion}` (for example `/micro/iglu/com.myvendor/myschema/jsonschema/1-0-0`)
